Description: 
    This package provides the Seqtometry scoring algorithm for the generation of single cell 
    gene set (signature) enrichment scores for scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq data. It also provides an
    implementation of Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells (MAGIC) in R (no Python needed).
